DYNAMIC EXECUTION
------------------------
Lots of places of the form EXECUTE "SELECT X FROM Y WHERE key=" || <something>
This something is usually a function of a parameter. Whole thing effectively can be compiled to an inlinable
SQL query.

CREATE FUNCTION fnc_pessoa3(pcpf character varying, pcampo character varying) RETURNS character varying
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
    AS $_$
 declare 
   result varchar;
   sql    text;
 begin
   sql := 'select '|| pcampo || ' from pessoas where cpf = $1';
   execute sql into result using pcpf;
   return result; 
   
 end;

------------------------
STATIC EXECUTION
------------------------
Plenty of instances where we SELECT from a table on another function. (SELECT <other udf>(x) FROM table)

------------------------
RAISES
------------------------
Usually tied to exceptions handling clauses.

Almost always of the form RAISE NOTICE "message: %", parameter

------------------------
EXCEPTIONS
------------------------
Exceptions such as duplicate_sql will be interesting to codegen as these just map to Insert calls returning false in tpl. These nice exception cases seem to happen mainly when we wrap around a sql execution.

------------------------
PERFORM
------------------------
instances where we perform pg_notify
used to invoke void functions. These void functions often just contain some insert or update statement.

-----------------------
Other notes
------------------------
ALTER table's are not inlinable by Froid right now and will be interesting to look into for compilation.
Lots of pg_dump
